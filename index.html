            <p>An interesting paradox in my life is that my greatest strength and weakness are the same: my ability to adapt to any given environment. It's a strength of mine because I have been able to sustain a bi-cultural lifestyle fluidly, live and build community in a variety of places around the world, and continue to learn even when no one is teaching. It is also a weakness in that I often find myself thirsting for change every few months.
            <br>I will pull from the range of my experiences and use empathy to build beautiful software services. That often requires a team, and I know I can lead, or co-lead many teams. I will spend time to really get to know the problem at hand to establish a north star anyone can follow.
            <br>I'm from Texas, so you know my heart is big. I've also lived in San Francisco, Tokyo and Madrid, so would love to chat about your travel interests before we get started. ;) See my contact page to get connected.</br></p>
